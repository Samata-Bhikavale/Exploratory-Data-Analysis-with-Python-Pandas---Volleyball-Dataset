# Data Analysis and Visualization of Player Skills

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that explores the distribution of various player skills such as **Attack**, **Block**, **Serve**, and **Receive** using data visualization techniques. The notebook demonstrates the process of analyzing and visualizing player skill data to derive insights and trends through various charts, including boxplots, histograms, and bar charts.


## Overview

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of player skill data. The main objective is to visualize the distribution of various skills and explore their relationships using graphs like:

- **Boxplot** for skill distributions.
- **Histogram** for frequency distributions.
- **Bar Chart** for aggregating and comparing skill values across different countries or positions.

## Dependencies

To run the Jupyter notebook, you'll need the following Python libraries:

- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `matplotlib`: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
- `seaborn`: For statistical data visualization.
- `numpy`: For numerical operations.
